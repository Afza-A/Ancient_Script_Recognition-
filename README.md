# Ancient_Script_Recognition-
This project focuses on identifying ancient manuscript scripts as Sanskrit or Tamil using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Single-character manuscript images are used to avoid overlapping and improve recognition accuracy.
Image reconstruction techniques such as denoising, thresholding, and sharpening are applied to enhance character clarity.
The reconstructed images improve readability while preserving the original structure of the script.
Overall, the system demonstrates an effective approach for script recognition and visual enhancement of historical manuscripts.
